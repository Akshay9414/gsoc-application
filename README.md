Hi, I am Akshay Gahlot from India and would like to work on "PRUs to offload processing of raw data from on-board Peripherals"

Here I have compiled helloworld.c using arm9 toolchain, which was present in the toolchain compiled already for Linux and I got it from here https://www.acmesystems.it/arm9_toolchain 
 
I compiled it using the command : `arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc -static -o helloworld.bin helloworld.c`

To execute the cross built binary, I put it onto an ARM Linux system and invoke helloworld.bin.
